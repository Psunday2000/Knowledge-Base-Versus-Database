## Knowledge-Base-Versus-Database

| Aspect                | Knowledge Base                | Database                             |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Purpose               | Contains domain-specific knowledge, rules, and expertise for decision-making in expert systems. | Stores structured data for efficient storage, retrieval, and management.         |
| Content               | Contains rules, facts, and domain-specific information structured for reasoning. | Contains raw data, records, and tables with minimal inference capability.  |
| Usage                 | Supports reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making in expert systems. | Used for data storage, retrieval, and querying in applications like websites or applications. |
| Rule-Based System    | Integral part of rule-based expert systems. | Data-driven applications often use databases as a backend. |
| Query Language        | May use a rule-based language for expressing knowledge and reasoning (e.g., CLIPS, Prolog). | Typically employs Structured Query Language (SQL) for data retrieval and manipulation. |
| Data Manipulation     | Emphasizes reasoning and inference, allowing for complex decision-making. | Primarily focuses on data storage and retrieval, with limited built-in reasoning. |
